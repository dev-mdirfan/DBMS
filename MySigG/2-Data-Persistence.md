# What is Data Persistence

- Data Persistence means existence of data means availability of data until job gets done
- In any program we want to manage data
- Data that is required to manage needs to be stored somewhere until job is not over
- **Example -** Program for adding two numbers needs two number(data) and need to be store somewhere else until that task is done. -> Existence of data

## Life of Data

- Constants in the expressions
- Data stored in variables
- Data stored in secondary storage

## Life of variable

- Life of variable <= Life of program < Life of stored Data (Beyond end of program)
